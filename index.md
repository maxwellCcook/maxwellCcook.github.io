I am a fire ecologists focusing on the social-ecological impacts from changing fire regimes across the western US and globe. I use remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning (among other data science toolsets) to understand how changing fire regimes are impacting communities and ecosystems. I am interested in adaptive management strategies in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), understanding fire impacts to the built environment, evacuation and emergency management planning, and assessing forest and fuel treatment success.
